# thanos-gauntletðŸ˜ˆ
The Infinity Gauntlet for Thanos snap.
Like Google Easter Egg.

# Usage [How to destroy the world!]
```bash
npm i thanos-gauntlet
```

```js
import Gauntlet from 'the-infinity-gauntlet'

let gauntlet = new Gauntlet(elementClassName)
gauntlet.snap()
```

All right, you can run `gauntlet.snap()` again to call all the things back,
the same as `gauntlet.back()`.
